Greeting,

This is my attempt of multiple-choice quiz.

So far I only construct the html, CSS and pseudo codes, and few javascript.

When you click on the start button, first question will pop out, and a timer on top right will start counting down.

Other parts are not done yet.

The javascript part got me into struggle.

I am still working on it, and will keep posting.

update:
Page is styled way clear than before.
Added feature when a user click on Start button, one question will pop out with 4 choices.
It will log correct/wrong after a user select one choice, and it will go to the next.
There will be penalty when a user got a wrong answer. Total time will be subtracted by a chunk.
Quiz is over when all questions are answered or when time reaches 0 second.
