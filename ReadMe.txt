Greeting,

This is my attempt of multiple-choice quiz.

So far I only construct the html, CSS and pseudo codes, and few javascript.

When you click on the start button, first question will pop out, and a timer on top right will start counting down.

Other parts are not done yet.

The javascript part got me into struggle.

I am still working on it, and will keep posting.
